					Identification of Dog Breed and suggesting the Foods and Vitamins section of this contains similar projects that have been done which are related to this topic.
					This research component’s purpose is to recognize the breed of the dog and suggest the foods and vitamins that have to be given depending on the dog’s breed, age, and weight. 
					The breed identification and food and vitamin store suggest components are implemented using machine learning technology.
					There has been similar research work in Belhumeur’s attempt to identify plant species was one of the earliest achievements in fine-grained classification.
					This method included segmenting a leaf and then determining the species based on its shape. On the other hand, a 2012 article by Liu et al. attempted to identify dog breeds using a similar strategy.
					They first use an SVM regressor using greyscale SIFT labels as elements to differentiate the dog’s face.

					According to research papers, many projects of mobile applications for dogs have been launched in foreign countries.
					In Sri Lanka, there are research has done on dogs. Therefore, the developing mobile application is very useful, and it has many functions such as user-friendliness, breed identification, suggestions of foods and vitamins, and high accuracy. 
					Most of the projects implemented in Sri Lanka for dogs’ mobile applications have very poor accuracy. 
					The results and their outcomes of them are not correct most of the time. The mobile application has records of previous foods and vitamins that the dog has.
					By referring many solutions that are implemented for dog breed identification have obtained very low ratings. Many customers have given negative feedback about the developed systems. 
					The “Dog breed identifier Photo Cam” mobile application is a software application for dog breed identifiers. It allows the user to upload the dog image or scan the image of the dog and then identify the breed of the dog. 
					By reading the comments and reviews regarding the mobile application it has many negative feedbacks and as a result, it has only 2.9 rates for reviews. 
					It is a below count and many people have voted as the gallery option is not shown in their mobile application and many advertisements are playing during the usage time of the system.
					During the scanning time also, it shows advertisements. Another special thing is the application takes more time to close all advertisements and sometimes it identifies the breed also as the wrong breed. The accuracy and user-friendliness are very low in this application. 
					Embark Breed Identification identifies the breed of the dog after registering the user to their mobile application and activating their kit. Then the user has to mail the swab then they identify the breed after two or four weeks. 
					It takes so much time and many users have complained it is not worth the price. The existing mobile applications have raised many problems.
					Therefore, the PupStar mobile application has many advanced developed systems.
					The accuracy of the PupStar application is very high. It always identifies the breed of the dog clearly and recommends relevant food and vitamin according to the weight and age of the dog.
					Many mobile applications have no dog breed identification and recommend food and vitamins. Mainly food and vitamins are recommended through websites as reading material.
					But in the PupStar application, it has the user only has to give the weight and age.

					<h2 class="title">RESEARCH PROBLEM</h2>


				</div><!-- /.section-title -->
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					With time, it seemed pets grow more and more integrated into home families.
					Given the pandemic's influence on greater time at home, this trend has since escalated.
					People are becoming more conscious of their pets' health as they spend more time with them, and they are concerned about their meals.
					Despite the economic downturn, pet owners continue to seek the best value and quality for their animals.
					A pet food and human food ingredients supplier offers information on how much pet owners value the possible health advantages of pet meals and ingredients.
					For example, according to a survey, 72 percent of dog owners agree that high-quality pet foods are effective in preventive health care, and 75 percent of both dog owners agree that pets with specific health issues can benefit from pet food formulations targeting those conditions.
					"Last Sunday, she was a perfectly healthy normal 3-year-old Bernese Mountain dog," Burnton said.
					"And as of Friday, she was on her last breath. After ingesting part of the pet food, his dog died of kidney failure. 
					The above statement is captured from the ABC News website.
					So, it is a clear indication that pet food can occasionally be harmful to your beloved pet.
					Referring to the news and articles of the world shows that many people have no idea about the food and vitamins of dog.
					And also, they have no clear understanding of their pet’s breed. 
					Because of the lack of knowledge regarding their dog’s food and vitamins they could not give the proper food to their pets. 
					So, on that, the dog gets weak and poor in health.
					It is very important to know about the healthy food system for the loving dog. 
					Also, people are more likely to be stressed, and with a busy life, people may not have time to look after everything for dogs.
					Also, when a dog becomes unwell, most people are unwilling to take it to a veterinary clinic. 
					Because most people are not able to find the best veterinarian clinics. 
					Dogs are unable to communicate with humans. Thus, if individuals visit the worst vet clinics, it will be impacted the dogs. 
					So that, people are lack trust in these veterinary clinics. Because for the time being, users can obtain a rate for location by using Google Maps. But the veterinary clinic and dog material shop will not be decided these are the best places by the rating system.
					<br><br>
					The language we use matters. Whether we’re assessing a dog’s behavior, teaching it new tricks, or sharing our own experiences with dogs in shelters, our words are important and powerful.
					Our interactions with and observations of pets help us learn more about their behavior, which enables us to choose a pet that is a good fit for a particular home. The language we use has a direct impact on how valuable the information we deliver is.
					<br>
					Mostly the dog owner does not understand the dog's diseases of his pet. Also, we recently heard that a little girl was taken to her home by a puppy that was on the road and willingly took care of her, and a few days later, the girl contracted an illness and died.
					Therefore, when raising a pet dog, it is essential to have an exceptionally good knowledge of dog diseases, but it is difficult for the owner to set aside a lot of time for that.
					Due to the pandemic also, people must suffer from their dog conditions because of a lack of knowledge and lack of care about pet dogs. So, this is raising a problem that should have a clear solution.

					<h2 class="title">METHODOLOGY</h2>


				</div><!-- /.section-title -->
				<p>
					Identification of Dog Breed and suggesting Foods and Vitamins section of the paper describes how the data sets are gathered and the implementation methodology used to recognize dog breeds and make predictions for the foods and vitamins that can be given to the pet dog, depending on their breed, age, and weight.
					To implement the dog breed identification part, a breed-classified data set was used. 
					The data set contained around 10000 images in total. To implement the function, several steps were used.
					A data set is a compilation of data. A data set is, alternatively, the elements of a single database column or statistical data matrix, in which each column of the table represents a particular variable, and each row represents a particular component of the under-discussion data set.
					Machine learning initiatives need a training data set. The data set was what the model was trained on to carry out different tasks. Training is the stage of machine learning that is most important.
					You feed the special set to your model of machine learning during training to find patterns and make predictions.
					As a result, the model gains knowledge from the data and can do the given task. Over time, the model gets better at forecasting. By placing the model towards the test on brand new data, this is accomplished. 
					The unseen data is taken from the testing set into which we previously divided our data. Our team won’t get an accurate answer if tested on the same data that was utilized for training because the model has become familiar with the results and has already seen the same patterns. 
					You will receive a disproportionally high level of accuracy as a result. The framework for breed recognition was constructed using the aforementioned stages. The model carried out more than 92 of percentage for training accuracy, which was also proven when making test predictions on this function.
					To implement the food and vitamin suggestion part, real-time data, captured from a veterinarian was used. Once the user uploads a picture of their pet dog, the model makes a prediction image, and the age and the weight are taken as user input.
					Using all these parameters, the prediction will be made for the foods and vitamins. This function is fully integrated and is available in a single mobile application.
